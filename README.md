# Wyvern (Demo/Example Custom Post Type with Custom Taxonomy, Custom Meta Box, Repeating Meta and Custom Meta Examples)
Wyvern is our example WordPress plugin that contains a basic custom post type, custom taxonomy, custom meta fields, and custom repeating meta boxes.  It is here to be used as a basis for these attributes of our WordPress projects.  Feel free to copy+paste+modify with this all day long.

This is a super basic custom post type plugin that creates a basic custom post type named 'Demo' with the slug 'demo'.  It has basic custom meta fields that can be used as an example when setting up a custom post type using custom meta.  The meta box contains extremely light custom styling to help break up the fields.  

This plugin can also be used as an example for when adding custom meta to a page template. Feel free to copy snippets of code from this plugin to use during template development if it expedites the process.
